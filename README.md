# ConUHacksVIII

### Inspiration: 
We were inspired by the global Vision Zero plan who's objective is to reduce serious road injuries and deaths. In the City of Montreal, we want to help the vulnerable and with this idea we hope to tackle the road safety issues. 

### What it does:
This data visualization allows you to see the map of Montreal and the different relationships which can be analysed such as the Pedestrian Crossing With vs Without Audio Cues, Pedestrian-Vehicle Collisions and with further analysis the relationship between these two maps for any correlation.

### How we build it:
 We used Angular for the front-end and this allows us we can switch between maps, and we used Python for the backend.


## Development server

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.3.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Run `python app.py` from the src folder for it to run

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
